# OpenMC Data Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts for generating HDF5 data
libraries that can be used with OpenMC. Some of these scripts convert existing
ACE libraries (such as those produced by LANL) whereas generate scripts use
NJOY to process ENDF files directly. Note that unless you are interested in
making a customized library, you can find pregenerated HDF5 libraries at
https://openmc.org. Another source of data libraries for OpenMC is the
[Windowed Multipole Library](https://github.com/mit-crpg/WMP_Library)
repository which enables on-the-fly Doppler broadening to an arbitrary
temperature.
